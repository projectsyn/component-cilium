TIP: Please update this section if you encounter this alert for a map which isn't listed yet.

`cilium_policy_*`::
This is the eBPF map which contains endpoint policy configurations.
Endpoint policy configurations are created from network policies in the cluster.
If this map fills up completely or if there's a high error rate for operations on this map, this can severely impact traffic on the cluster, since endpoints for which the policy map cannot be configured may not work correctly.
